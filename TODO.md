# TODO for HomeView UI Modifications

1. Add a banner slider below the toolbar.
   - Use images sourced from the internet for the slider.
   - Implement slider using a Flutter widget such as `PageView` or a package like `carousel_slider`.
   - Ensure images scale nicely and the slider supports swipe gestures.

2. Add a menu with 4 options below the banner slider.
   - Menu items: "absen", "pulang", "contoh 1", "contoh 2".
   - Design menu as buttons or icons with labels.
   - Menu layout to be a horizontal row with equal spacing.

3. Add a ListView below the menu to display news items.
   - Fetch or use placeholder news data.
   - Design news items with title, subtitle, image, and a clean card-like UI.
   - Implement scrolling for the list.

4. Test UI for responsiveness and good appearance.

Next Step:
- Based on confirmation, implement these UI components incrementally in `lib/views/home_view.dart`.
